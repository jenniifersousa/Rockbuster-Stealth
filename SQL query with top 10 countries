       A SQL query outputting the top 10 countries for Rockbuster Stealth in terms of customer numbers. 

SELECT D.country,
       COUNT(customer_id) AS customer_number
FROM customer A
INNER JOIN address B ON A.address_id = B.address_id
INNER JOIN city C ON B.city_id = C.city_id
INNER JOIN country D ON C.country_ID = D.country_ID
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY customer_number DESC
LIMIT 10

       Since Rockbuster wanted to knoww the top 10 countries with the most costumers, the first step was to look at the Entity Relationship Diagram to see
       what kind of relationship the country and customer tables had. According to the ERD I needed to join the customer, address, city, and country tables with the
       address and city tables being the links to the customer and country tables. After using the multiple join syntax, I grouped the data by country, sorted the 
       customer_number result-set by descending order, and limited the table by 10, since they only the top 10 countries were needed.
